Under Construction - more to come.

## To Be Updated

Email regarding this project:

It is now time for your next deliverable which will be your team projects. You have your features from assignment 2b, so it is now time to start coding. The final deliverable will be a working application which includes all the features from your feature list. Your projects will be submitted via a link to a GitHub repository as I do not want any zipped folders. Very important, your repository must have a README file that contains a clear description of your application and how to use it. As a software developer knowing how to use GitHub is a must, so this will give you the opportunity to showcase your work to future employers. Also, as part of your deliverable will be a project demo. This demo will be a video recording where you walk through your completed application. I will use this to aid me in grading, where if something does not work for me, I will use the demo to ensure the feature works and will not deduct points. I will create a submission link for this later.

## Things to Do

* [] Need to determine programming language to use for app development.
* [] Create tasks based on feature set that needs to be built out for application.
* [] Use Assignments 1, 2a and 2b to outline core features of app to be developed.
* [x] Provide initial Github reading material to team for review.
* [x] Create Github webhook to team channel in Discord.
